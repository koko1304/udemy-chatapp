WEBVTT

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.360
If the number of humans could be reduced by half...

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.200
If the number of forests is burnt by half...

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.660
If the number of human beings is reduced to a hundred...

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.830
Could existing waste...

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.030
become one in a hundred as well?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.130
Someone in the world definitely thinks so...

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.700
if you want to save the lives of others.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.530
What's wrong?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.930
Oww!

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.530
What are you doing?

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.960
A-A snake entered my hand!

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.700
Huh?

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700
A snake got into it...!

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.000
Really...
what are you thinking?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.430
Hey, wait--! Don't!

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.660
Are you really alright?

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.660
Huh?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.720
It's because you're listening to something like this,
that's why you got this strange dream?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.720
Good night.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.560
Good morning.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.460
Morning.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.530
Oh, no...
This turned out bad...

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.960
I'm going to leave first, okay?

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.760
Eat your breakfast properly.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.200
And don't forget your lunch.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.400
Hey...
Keep yourself together...

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.820
Somehow...
my right hand feels weird.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.050
Isn't it because of last night?

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.630
Strangling your own right hand
with your earphones and all.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.160
I'm heading out.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.880
What are you doing?

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.800
I'm going shopping at the next shop.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.730
Huh...?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.330
What's with that surprised expression?

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.130
Stop doing that.
What are you gonna do if my heart stopped?

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.100
Oh, c'mon. You're okay, right?

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.230
Don't mess around.
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.630
Ho-ho, you're blushing!
You're really cute when you do that.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.630
Argh, get off me!

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.100
W-What is it?

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.860
Now, wait a second!
What the hell are you doing!?

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.800
Eh, huh?

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.800
I-I can't believe this!

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.628
<i>In 1952, ECSC ...</i>

00:07:22.638 --> 00:07:28.740
The European Coal and Steel Community
is established.

00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:32.514
<i>This was 1950</i>

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:35.215
<i>when the French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman</i>

00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:39.120
<i>In order to prevent war
from breaking out between Germany and France</i>

00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:42.788
<i>proposed a bill...</i>

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.900
Run!

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.800
Pass it over!

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.330
Izumi, pass it!

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.630
That was great, Izumi.
Nice shot!

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.660
Carry on with the game.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.200
Hey...

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.200
"Hand moves involuntarily"

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.730
<i>I failed... I failed...</i>

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.110
<i>I didn't eat...</i>

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.760
<i>I failed, I failed.</i>

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.630
What the hell are you?

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.960
<i>What... are you?</i>

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.200
My right hand...

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.460
<i>My right hand...</i>

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.460
<i>I ate it.</i>

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.160
You ate it!?

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.200
<i>Teach me... to talk...</i>

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.700
Shinichi.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.260
Huh!?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.830
<i>Currently, the IAEA is carrying out
an investigation into a case.</i>

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.130
IAEA.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.800
Research.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.930
IAEA.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.930
Research.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.460
Mom, I'm home.
Is the dinner ready yet?

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.700
I'm hungry.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960
Welcome back.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.660
Hey, mom!
Where's the food!?

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.660
I'm really hungry.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.660
Although I'm awake...

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.060
the dream is still continuing.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.230
Hey, c'mon.
Gimme my right hand back.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.030
I can't right now!

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.830
I'm gathering information.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.330
You, since when did you
learn to talk so well...?

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.260
Studying the Japanese language,
one day is enough.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.130
<i>Shinichi...</i>

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.860
<i>Shinichi, you'll be late.</i>

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.960
I'm up, mom!
Everything's fine!

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.960
What's okay, anyway?

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.200
Mom/Mother...

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.760
the body associated with Shinichi,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.400
from the relationship with the father who lived in this house.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.060
You know what a hospital is?

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.760
A place where the wounded and sick are treated.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.900
I'll go there and let them cut you out!

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.430
I refuse!

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.900
I live on the cells that exists inside Shinichi.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.700
If you do that, I would immediately die.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.030
That's why I'm going to let them cut you out.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.620
It will cause Shinichi to lose his right hand.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.760
No point in doing that.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.890
So what the heck?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.560
No use asking questions.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.760
Where did you come from?

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.260
Coming from nowhere,
and going nowhere?

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.700
What was I actually?

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.230
What answer can you give?

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.400
Shut up!

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.930
I do not have any memories.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.100
My first memory starts with
failing to take over your brain.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.010
And thinking that it's too bad.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.620
Brain?

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.930
You're planning on taking my brain?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.230
Because I've become a hand...

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.600
continuing my main mission is now impossible.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.060
My feeling is wrapped up in despair.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.660
That's my line.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.400
Can you read faster?
It'd be bad if you got seen.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.930
I do the same thing as you to learn.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.800
No way?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.130
To know the world that you live in,
I need a lot of information.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.000
It doesn't seem like a thing a right hand should say.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.160
Don't think like that.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.760
Don't you want to be somebody?

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.900
You're annoying, monster.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.560
I do not agree with you calling me that.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.030
So what do I call you?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.530
If I really need a name...

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.530
call me Migi.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.830
Migi?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.800
As in a right hand?

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.600
Right.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.860
So you can also think of
simple things like that, huh?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.500
This kind of movements are very intriguing.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.830
Stop talking out loud here.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.460
I want to know more.
Take me somewhere else.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.000
I see. Compared to the melee combat a while ago,
this focuses on a longer range?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.200
Like I said, don't talk out loud!

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.700
What kind of training do you have, Shinichi?

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.030
I...

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.700
don't do training.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.230
You're late, Satomi...

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.300
Sorry, it took me a while.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.560
Oh, you came.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.100
If you do something like that again,
I'll kill you. Got it?

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:09.830
It's just--

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:10.530
What?

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.860
Sorry.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.030
Oh...

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.030
It's turning out pretty good.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.460
Why did you pick that?

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.660
Because I don't have talent like you.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:26.930
That's how it is.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.330
Eh...

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
But you're doing great over there.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.130
Hey...

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.730
Your model...

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.230
could it be Satomi?

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:41.680
Huh!?

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.330
Don't say random things...

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
Hey, it's a woman, right?

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.900
You're not being honest.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.530
Shinichi...

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.900
What the hell, you guys?

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.230
I'll just restart it!

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.200
Wah!?

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.660
Heh?!

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.280
Sorry for interrupting...

00:15:17.163 --> 00:15:19.727
Shinichi, do you want to
mate with that female?

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.290
Hah?

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.570
Murano Satomi.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.900
What do you know of it?

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.900
I know about the sword...

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.400
down here.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.100
Can I investigate?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.330
Don't joke around!

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.100
I'm not joking.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.460
I'm interested in this!

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:45.660
Ah, wait--!
Stop, stop. Stop!

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.300
Welcome...

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.930
The price is 268 yen, and 980 yen for this,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.130
Total 1248 yen for all.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.760
Where are we going?

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.460
Where would you like to go to?

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:42.997
<i>[Motive unknown,
Method unknown]</i>

00:16:42.997 --> 00:16:44.999
<i>[Multiple killings discovered!]</i>

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.602
<i>[Terrifying acts of murder?]</i>

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.060
<i>For safety reasons,
please store your luggage.</i>

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:54.060
<i>Do not leave anything behind,
and check again before you alight.</i>

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.900
<i>To stop at the next stop,
please press the buzzer.</i>

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.130
What are you doing!?

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.600
We have to get off!

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.500
Stop doing that with everyone around!

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.100
There, it's there!

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:17.960
What is?

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.400
I felt the real brain eaters.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.030
Even though it's my first time.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.130
This...

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.560
But why?

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560
Your same kind?

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.030
Others just like you?

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.560
The distance is about 200 meters.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.330
Come on.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.760
I don't wanna!

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.060
Hah?

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.060
I-It's not what you think.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.330
I need to know what it was
I'm supposed to have become.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.200
Ok fine, I'll go.
Just calm down.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:05.860
Here?

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.100
Yes, the distance out is only 5 meters.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.200
Idiot!

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.600
Stop it!

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.560
Fellow kind?

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.360
You've come to a good place.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.360
This place is nice...

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.360
By waiting alone,

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.330
I can get my next meal.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.400
This is the original host.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.330
Hmm?

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.560
What is this?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.500
Is the brain still intact?

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.800
Now, that's bad...

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.430
Very bad...

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.760
Shinichi, run!
I sense killing intent!

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.260
You're a human.
You can't win!

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.860
Shinichi!

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.630
Wait!

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.330
If you lay a hand on this human,
I'll kill you!

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.630
I understand where you're coming from.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.960
If the host dies,
you too won't be able to live.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.300
So, you just have to move over here.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.160
Move?

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.060
To do that...
it's impossible.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.260
Seems you haven't done your homework at all.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.900
It is impossible for one head with two brains.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.160
But...

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.460
if it is from hand to hand,
then it's possible.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.830
Look, I've cut it off.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.530
Move over here.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.530
Move over from that body.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.460
My body should be better, right?

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.600
Migi?

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.800
You not going to listen to him, are you?

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.800
C'mon, say something!

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.560
Ah, whatever.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.830
I'll cut off that whiny boy's head!

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.730
Are you serious!?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.160
My body...

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.530
My body...

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.200
Is he dead?

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.130
Good thing we watched those sword fights.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.660
You...

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.830
You've killed one of your comrades.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.300
There was no other option.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.500
If you die, I die.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.500
His proposal was risky.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.500
You saved me!

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.830
This is not for you.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.160
I just saved myself.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.160
And also perhaps,

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.600
someday maybe I'll leave.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.000
Hey...

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.130
Remember not drink too much.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.200
Tell your wife to come over, okay?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.560
Ok, I'll remember to tell her.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.430
Get well soon.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.400
Thank you very much.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.260
I'll finish up soon,
so wait there a bit.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.930
I'll go shopping first, okay?

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.200
Welcome.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.960
Two mincemeat, please.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.160
All right.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.430
Why mince?

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.900
Huh? You like it, don't you?

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.200
Don't have any appetite?

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.830
Is there a problem?

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.760
Eh?

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.530
You've been acting weird lately...

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.030
I'll be a 3rd year soon, right?

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.630
It's just school work stressing me out,
that's why I'm like this.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:07.600
Oh, I see.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.660
<i>A body was discovered in a car,
in a car park in Kanagawa.</i>

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.130
<i>Sakagami Kohei was identified as the victim,
aged 41 years and died on the spot.</i>

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.330
Apparently, I can't tell mom.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.400
It's better that way.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.060
But if this continues,
the victims will continue to grow.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.260
Actually I want to tell her all about you.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:33.860
Why?

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.630
Only I know what's going on.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.400
I can't just keep quiet, right?

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.930
You will be arrested as one of the suspects.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.630
Is there no way?

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.460
If you don't do something about your friends soon...

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.460
Shinichi, I don't understand your logic.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.860
My kind are just eating.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.500
I'm digesting the nutrients in your blood as food

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.960
but the others had to rely on themselves to find food.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.830
But they don't have to eat people...

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.360
Shinichi, why are you against eating other humans?

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.330
Hah?

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.130
Don't you understand?

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.330
Human lives are precious.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.330
The most precious thing is one's own life.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.760
For me, that is the most important thing.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.760
That's because you're all just monsters!

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.700
For you humans, you eat cows, pigs,
birds, fish and many others.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.700
Whatever plants and animal,
you've eaten them all.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.130
By comparison, isn't eating human beings,
not as awful as you all?

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.830
You can't compare it that way...

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.160
In short, Shinichi.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.960
If you continue to give me the nutrients to live,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.760
I will fully protect you from anything.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.130
If you're going to harm me,

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.560
making you unable to talk will be easy.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.260
Even if I cannot take the rest of the body...

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.560
Eh?

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.730
Very nice expression.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.430
Demon!

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.930
Demon?

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.430
Thank you very much.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.100
What's the result?

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.130
We saw body parts...

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.430
however, it doesn't look like a human being.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.960
Hah?

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.630
The owner?

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.160
You mean he ate people?

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.560
Man-eater...

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.800
He was found dead in a position like this.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.500
Detective, what exactly is this?

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.600
It makes no sense.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.760
Shinichi, after being called a demon,

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.460
turns out humans are what's closest to it.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.660
<i>At the start of this new semester...</i>

00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:43.830
<i>many of you will find yourselves
at different points of your goal.</i>

00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:51.800
<i>Do not give up, but push yourselves as hard as you can.
That goal can be reached with every little step.</i>

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.800
<i>Therefore, for all of you who have come here,</i>

00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:00.560
<i>please continue to strive for the best.</i>

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.630
Shinichi.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.800
I felt a presence.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.560
One of my kind is near.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.230
You've got to be kidding...

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.900
Don't look for it.
It's also searching for us.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.830
There's no way it would take the fight
to a crowd as big as this.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.200
<i>And that's the end of my speech.</i>

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:26.000
So, to substitute Mr. Machiyama due to an accident,

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.330
I will be introducing you our new teacher.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.330
Please.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.530
There she is!

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:40.960
For real...?

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.500
Don't look!
We'll be spotted!

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.560
Tamiya Ryouko.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.470
Nice to meet you all.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.000
Don't be afraid.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.000
Come closer to me.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.700
I can hear your heartbeat pounding from here.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.300
Don't worry.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:40.230
If a fight takes place here,
we will both be harmed.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.230
Besides,

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.700
if there's killing intent in the air,

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.230
your right hand would have sensed it.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.160
It's Migi.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.960
Surviving on one of the host's body parts...
it's unimaginable...

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.600
I didn't reside here on purpose.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.760
You...

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.260
what are you planning to do in this school?

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.260
Planning something?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.500
I just want to live normally.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.100
I want to talk more,
but it seems impossible here.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.960
Your girlfriend...

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.730
Come look for me after school.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.960
I want to talk directly to you.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.760
Fine.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.230
You don't get to decide.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.700
I don't want to talk with you!

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.560
Izumi,

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.900
mind your manners when talking to your teacher.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.900
See you later.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.860
Acting like a real teacher...

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.930
We have to go.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.930
If she's planning something,
what're we gonna do?

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.930
I was surprised to see it,

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.030
but although it ate her brain,
she's living like a human.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.030
Maybe it could solve our existing problem.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.830
In addition, she teaches manners to a human.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.830
That really surprised me.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.360
I want to know more!

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.600
Taking me to a place like this...
Just what do you want to talk about?

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.130
There are two more,
the distance is 10 metres away.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:32.800
Two!?

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.400
What is the meaning of this, Tamiya?

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.220
Distance from them, 1 metre.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.380
I can totally see it.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.370
I will introduce them to you.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.220
Shimada Hideo.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:54.810
Yo.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.300
He's the same as you, a high school kid.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.360
I thought it would be convenient
if you two talked to each other.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.330
The other is an officer...

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:04.740
You don't need to know my name.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.480
In that case,

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.010
call him Mr. A.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.100
There's even a police officer...

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.320
disturbing.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.740
This is Izumi Shinichi,

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.540
and also Migi.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.330
You really took his right hand, huh?

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.730
That's interesting.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.730
This is real.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.470
What made you want to take these people
into our Network,

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.180
Tamiya Ryouko?

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.500
For collecting data.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.490
What's a Network?

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.490
I told you to shut it!

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.850
To survive,

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.950
we need each other's help.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:49.580
Such as,

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.820
finding hidden places to eat everyday.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.510
In order not to look like a homicide.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.720
But lately,
don't you think everything has been reported?

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.380
News of the amputee and the man-eating?

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.380
So what?

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.090
It's because you can't hide what you're doing.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.810
What we are looking for,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.160
are people who will not be missed.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.380
We were all sharing information

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.070
in order to learn from each other.
It's very important,

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.700
the Network.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.090
Don't tell me...
you want us to join your Network?

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.760
But I'm not entirely the same as you.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.240
We are monsters.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.820
I agree.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.740
So I conducted an experiment.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:53.930
Mr. A and I had sex.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.860
As a result, I'm now pregnant.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.330
So in other words,

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.930
what is this something that exists inside me?

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:16.740
Both of you used humans bodies,
therefore a human being was created.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360
That's right.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:22.070
What I have inside me is a human child.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.360
So the question arises,

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.080
what are we, actually?

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:37.180
We do not have an original body
and just took over someone else's.

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.200
How can it be possible?

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:52.420
Just for what purpose
do we exist in this world?

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.300
Like I know...

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.940
Leaving that aside,
we just want to protect ourselves.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.830
I'm thinking of our future cooperation.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.140
I refuse, ok?

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.410
I'm asking Migi.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.810
At least don't disturb us,

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:13.060
or do something like oppose us.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:21.340
I can kill a whole class within 3 seconds.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.210
Remember, the school is my hostage.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.400
Including your girlfriend.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.720
See you next time.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.900
Shinichi,

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.680
beware of A.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.480
I can sense killing intent from him.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.730
It turns out that a menstruating woman tastes awful.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.350
Make sure you finish up the rest!

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.450
And keep the place clean for us to eat.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.640
Don't you want to a have a bite?

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.840
I'm doing an experiment.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:46.710
Disgusting. Eating something like that...
it's not good for your body.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.160
Tamiya Ryouko.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:53.010
Do you really plan on taking that human in as our colleague?

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.650
If we can think like how humans think,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.220
Izumi Shinichi and Migi

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.480
will make the ideal subjects of research.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.540
You guys,

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.180
should be able to also understand this.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.490
Especially you, A.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.550
In order to survive in this human world.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.800
Like me, right?

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.550
The newly opened restaurant has really good food.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.510
Should we go there sometime?

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.190
Sure.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.700
Don't be shy,
we can think about it occasionally.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.860
I think it's better
if you don't leave the house that often.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:44.790
Eh?

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.880
Because there are many incidents happening outside.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.680
Lately, I haven't been able to talk to you.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.880
No need to worry about little things like that.
See you later.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.130
Wait a minute, Shinichi.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.890
Something must have happened?
Tell me.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.360
Nothing happened!

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.010
Don't hide things from your parents.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.820
I know something's happening with you.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.610
I'm not a kid anymore.
Hiding something... it's only natural, right?

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.480
Just remember...

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.710
that I'm always here to give you a hand.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.440
Stop doing that!
I'm not a kid anymore!

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.330
I can take care of myself,
so don't worry.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.710
Hot water or hot oil
causing local tissue damage on skin called a "burn".

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.080
Whenever you see your mother's scars,
your blood pressure rises.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.840
I want to know why would a mother do that.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.020
That's got nothing to do with you.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.870
Yes, it has.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.970
Because the nutrients I got was good.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.260
Pan fried tempura.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.720
When I was 4 years old,
I almost got splashed by hot oil on the head.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.240
I turned out fine because mom caught the pot immediately.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.550
Even now,

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.370
whenever it rains her scars will itch.

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.620
Sacrificing yourself to protect others.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.770
It is something I cannot understand about humans.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.710
As for your painting... it's not someone else.
It's your mom, right?

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.110
The distance is 20 meters.
Shinichi, he's here.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.170
It's Mr. A from yesterday.
We should wait for him to pass by.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.730
This killing intent...
he's serious this time.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.740
What do we do now?

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.270
He also seems to have good fighting skills.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.880
We best avoid him.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.420
There is a choice of Plan A and Plan B,
which one do you want?

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.380
If so,

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.670
Plan A then.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.400
So first, we avoid him.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.110
I'll do the talking.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.340
What do you think you're doing?

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.410
I'm not the same as Tamiya Ryouko.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.500
What's the point of our kind
fighting each other?

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.270
Our kind?

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.140
Your kind with whom?

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.840
Why don't you let us pass?

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:13.190
During the recent murder case,
I saw his body at police headquarters.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.820
At that time,
we had to find out the cause of that incident.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.620
There is only one thing I know who can kill that way...

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.220
and it's parasites alone.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.760
You are dangerous.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.740
Leave the attacks to me.
But our victory will depend on you, Shinichi.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.610
Shinichi!

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.050
Hurry!

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:31.990
Shinichi!

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.790
What is this?

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.800
The blood won't stop.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.120
Your body is slowly failing
because of massive hemorrhage.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.780
You will completely bleed out.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.950
Disregarding an attack from a human
was your biggest mistake.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:11.460
It can't be...
that--

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.360
A human...

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.580
What's wrong with you?
You haven't taken any damage.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.950
That was a human body.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.320
I've killed a man!

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.360
When his brain was taken over,
he was no longer a human.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.520
What's with you!?

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.440
Human nature

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:04.630
really is hard to comprehend.

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:07.800
That Plan B... what's that?

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.020
There is no such thing.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.980
It was only the option to make it easy.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.310
Huh!?

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:14.420
Welcome.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.660
2 packs of minced meat.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.700
All right.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.090
My son loves eating it.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.320
Oh, I see...

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.420
This body can no longer survive.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.960
If there is a new body,

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:06.360
cut...

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.710
separate...

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.810
merge...

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.220
replace...

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.560
Cut...

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.800
Are you alright?

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:54.950
Cut...

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:57.590
separate...

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.560
merge...

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.580
Replace...!

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.440
Shinichi, this is bad!
Shinichi!

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.450
What the heck?

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.940
150 meters.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:17.250
140 meters.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:18.940
It's getting closer.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.800
Another one!?

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:23.050
I can't take this anymore!

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.500
30 meters.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.670
20 meters.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.220
I can beat it, I can beat it, I can beat it...

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.180
10 meters.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:40.360
What's wrong?

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.330
He stopped in front of the house.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.200
Give me a break...!

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.200
It can't be...

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.160
He's coming in...

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.160
How does he have our house key?

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.340
This feeling...

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.570
Mom?

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.270
Shinichi, you're wrong.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.680
It's you, right, mom?

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.780
It's A!

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.040
What're you talking about?
A is dead, right?

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.690
Mom.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.700
Welcome home.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.090
That's A!
You have to realize that, Shinichi!

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:42.200
Stop it, Migi!

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.730
He separated from his old body,
and moved to your mother's body!

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:47.280
Don't go saying things like that!

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.950
It's the truth, Shinichi!

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.800
Too bad...

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.500
It turns out that the body I took was your...

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.310
Mom, I'm sorry...

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.440
C'mon, mom...
stop joking around like that...

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.840
Don't, Shinichi!

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:08.890
Your mother is not human anymore!

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.670
I told you to shut up, right!?
You're the monster!

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.380
Mom...

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:16.730
I'm sorry for hiding it from you.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.640
T-This is just...

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.620
I'm just afraid that mom will worry about it,
so I didn't tell you.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.660
I was looking for the right time to talk about it.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:35.370
It's because I'm weak and afraid,
that's why I didn't want to make you worry.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.320
I always wanted to thank you.

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.260
From the beginning,
I really wanted you to know...

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.130
That's why...!

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.820
Please tell me it's all a joke, mom!

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:50.850
Mom...

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:53.740
Shinichi!

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.700
Shinichi!

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.360
Shinichi!

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.020
I pierced his heart, so it's over.

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.560
You will also die with him.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.940
Because you didn't take the brain of that boy.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.700
You're awake? It's a miracle.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.780
I used a piece of myself to cover up
the hole left in your body.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.900
Then I left a part of me in your heart
that had been destroyed.

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.240
Afterwards, I slowly returned back into your right hand.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.200
It was like a risky experiment.
But luckily it turned out well.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.630
You should've just left me to die...

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.520
Mom...

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:42.020
Forget it! She's been taken over by A!

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.580
You haven't been to school these past few days.
Why, I wonder?

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.580
Shinichi?

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.180
Are you alright?

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.840
Where are you going?

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:32.910
Shinichi!

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:34.170
Stop following me.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.660
Shinichi!

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:54.360
Near your house, a policeman's body was found.
It was on the news.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.400
Was that your doing?

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.680
Do you know where A is?

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.220
You killed him already, right?

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.760
That's what we thought at first,
but he had taken over Shinichi's mother.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.160
Shinichi and me were almost killed.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.420
So for those few days,
you were repairing his cells.

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.500
Where's A?

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.660
I don't know.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.680
Don't lie to me!
He's in your Network, isn't he!?

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.080
Even if I do know,

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.460
I won't tell you.

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.180
So you're hiding your friend?

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.820
We all have a personality of our own.

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:31.540
A has a strong personality,
so he's considered dangerous.

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.020
If you already knew about that,
then why introduce us to A?

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.000
An experiment.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.660
Just an experiment.

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.550
Just an experiment?

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.950
You did it just for that!?

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:05.920
Brave, aren't we?

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.650
If you insist,

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:14.180
then it seems I have no choice.

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.660
For a while, I saw...

00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:31.510
a change in you.

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.000
Interesting...

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:41.060
You two really are interesting.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.380
Wait!

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:56.660
Looks like we'll meet again, Izumi.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.320
I swear I'll find you.

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.900
No matter what, I'll find you.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
I'll kill you.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.000
Detective.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:43.650
Huh?

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.180
About the fish market police killing,
a residual fingerprint has been found consistent...

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:52.310
...with the iron pipe weapon
and the back door of the restaurant murder.

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:55.380
So the suspect is the same...

00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.840
About the victim at the scene,

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.340
they found human flesh in his stomach.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.240
How can it be possible?

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:08.480
Can't you see?

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.510
I'm eating right now.

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:15.560
But you're still looking at these photos, right?

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.460
Then, the rumors are true...

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.500
that there are unknown
parasitic organisms infecting the body.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:30.080
Don't rush in with conclusions,
or the top will put the brakes on this investigation.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.200
This station is one we haven't visited yet...

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.130
Where are we going?

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.970
I don't know.
I just want to walk somewhere today.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:46.420
What if we accidentally crossed paths with A?

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.530
You've got a radar.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.820
That's not an effective way.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.430
If you were to meet A in this state...

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.090
What's up?

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.350
Someone's within 200 meters.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.610
Is it A?

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:01.460
I have no idea.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:03.170
But, Shinichi...

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:05.190
It isn't just one or two...

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.010
<i>The reason is simple.</i>

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.750
Is it in this crowd?

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:21.590
I can't sense it clearly.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.410
I only know they're around here...

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.850
Really!?

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.660
Shinichi.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.690
What?

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:30.020
In this crowd...

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.620
among this crowd...

01:01:34.754 --> 01:01:39.855
<i>Reduce the seats of parliamentary members!
Cut off the excess and redundant!</i>

01:01:40.993 --> 01:01:42.783
<i>Not just the parliament</i>

01:01:43.262 --> 01:01:46.622
<i>In each area we have to separate the wheat from the chaff!</i>

01:01:46.899 --> 01:01:47.933
<i>Cut off the excess!</i>

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.710
Not A, but...

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.280
It's the one on the stand, huh?

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.050
This is surprising.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:05.170
I was shocked by Tamiya Ryouko being a teacher,
and now they have someone in politics.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:10.420
So they want to create a place where people can be eaten?

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:16.000
To control the town and have a place for them to gather.
There's no mistake.

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:21.280
After a few months,
they will become a highly evolved group.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.880
You're too enthusiatic about all this...

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.600
Maybe someday,
the parasites will have full control over the entire world!

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.740
Don't talk about it so casually.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.910
As if you monsters can do something like that.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.800
You're underestimating us humans.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.080
Izumi Shinichi, right?

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:53.970
Um, yes.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.620
So... you live alone now?

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:00.150
That's right.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.320
You cook for yourself?

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:04.970
Once in a while, yeah.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.250
What about your future?

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:12.920
My mom still left me a decent amount of savings, so... umm...

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.370
Don't worry about it.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.920
Sometime ago,
there was a case where a policeman was killed?

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.170
Do you know anything about it?

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:32.420
Not really.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:58.620
Is that so?

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.920
Pardon our intrusion.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.220
Well, thanks for everything.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.150
Migi!

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:39.470
Good morning.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.120
It's been difficult, huh?

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.500
I hope you find your mom soon.

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.420
What about your meals?

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:52.970
No problem.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400
If you want,

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.000
I can make you some.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.750
It's him...

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.570
Good morning.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.900
This is Shimada, our new transfer student.

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:17.020
I'm Shimada Hideo. Nice to meet you.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.460
You can't shake with your right hand?

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.020
Why the hell are you here?

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.700
C'mon, what are you saying?

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.120
There, hope you two become friends.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.080
What's wrong...?

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.040
Well then...

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.480
What was that?

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.020
I'm only testing out his power.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.420
Good morning!

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.880
Got into another fight?

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.060
No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.360
Hey, that guy just now.
That was the new transfer student, right?

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.140
You do remember, right?

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:51.460
Murano Satomi and the rest of the school are her hostage.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.660
Damn her...

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.500
It seems his physical strength has been greatly increased.

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:04.640
Migi's presence must have had
an effect on his body.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:09.280
Basically, he was not supposed to be like this.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.620
But as I thought...
he is changing...

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.960
He really is interesting, huh.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.980
I now understand why you want to study him.

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.800
To obtain such an information...

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.760
they both play a very important piece.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.180
I'm going out again to find A.

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.460
I already told you that when your heart was destroyed,

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.040
I used my cells to repair it.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.680
Those parts of me are still alive, it seems.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.400
And they're flowing through your blood.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.080
So can't you take it out?

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.320
As my cells are tiny particles,
they're now fused inside your body.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.140
I cannot recall them anymore.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.480
So what you're saying is...?

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.480
That my body is starting to become more like you?

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.440
I don't want to look like you.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.620
Where are we going anyway?

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.160
Today we'll do a little sightseeing.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:14.640
You're gonna look for A again, right?
It seems not only your body is changing, but so is your personality.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.180
I want you to stop.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.460
You know I can't.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.860
If you do see her,
there's nothing you can do.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.880
The dead won't come back,
so think about your own life.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:25.880
Moreover...

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.920
don't be concerned about my problem.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.080
Your problem?

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.640
After saving you,
I now have to sleep for 4 hours each day.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.980
I also sleep for 8 hours.

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.940
Unlike you, I can't be woken up when asleep.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.080
It's as if I'm dead during that time.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.880
I also don't know when it'll happen.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.580
That means...
if an enemy appears and you fall asleep...

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.520
Good luck on your running away.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.600
What!?

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.400
Here it comes!

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:56.940
Eh?

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.740
I'm sleepy.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.300
Hey!

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.420
Sorry, but I'm going to bed.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.480
Hey, wait a minute! Hey! Hey!

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.020
How to identify parasites?

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.080
"Once you pull out their hair,
the hair will react by curling."

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.360
...that's what it says here.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:20.920
Oww!

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.480
So you're not one of them, huh?

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.560
What is the meaning of this?

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.760
I told you not to arouse more suspicion.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.560
Looks like they found a way to detect us,
just by pulling out our hair.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.560
That is a problem.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.840
Isn't it because you're often playing
with things that interest you?

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.420
You better stop it--

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.420
I'm grateful for your concern.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.960
But it's not because of them.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.340
In fact,

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.860
those are my precious samples.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.800
If you're going to continue with your experiments,

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.640
just be careful with them.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.860
I...

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.600
I'm also thinking about the future of our kind.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.260
When I get elected,

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:35.580
I will make you all my subordinates,
and reorganize the system.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.140
Don't you worry.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.220
Tamiya.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.320
How's your baby?

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.060
It can already move.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.680
It's body is developing
just like an ordinary human.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.200
Hey, how about I cook you dinner tonight?

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.900
I don't mind. Do it then.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.480
It can't be helped then.
I'll make something healthy!

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.900
She has a point. Balanced food is
good for your health. Obviously for me, too.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.040
Sorry about the food I ate lately.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.800
And this is also an opportunity to approach her.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.760
You're always talking about it.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.540
Who are you whispering to?

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.540
No, it's nothing.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.700
Shinichi, you've been a little scary lately.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.740
Eh?

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.140
I can understand it a bit
because of what happened.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.120
I think you really have changed,
not like before when you were a bit shy and wishy-washy.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.040
Because that's what makes you so cute.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.820
What the heck is that...

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.360
But now I'm relieved.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.240
Relieved to know that you're still you.

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:10.488
So any comments?

01:12:10.489 --> 01:12:12.347
No, no...

01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:13.953
Just it seems a bit much...

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.120
What is it?

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.880
I thought I heard something.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.240
Poor dog...

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.380
Watch out!

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.280
It's too late.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.500
He's dead.

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.440
What are you doing!?

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:18.000
What do you think you're doing?

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.460
I'm just throwing away garbage.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.250
That's not garbage!

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:25.120
Don't you pity it?

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.740
But it's already dead.

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.960
Since it's dead,
it's not a dog anymore.

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:34.960
Now it's just flesh and bones.

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.000
You...

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.680
you're Shinichi, right?

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.970
What's wrong?

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.330
Sorry.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.130
Looks like I got the wrong person.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.720
Hey, Migi...

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.810
Did I say something wrong?

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:24.810
You said that body is
just made up of flesh and bones.

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.450
That's something I would be saying.

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.260
I see...

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.540
She really hates me now, huh...

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.010
Umm, Ms. Tamiya...

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:47.940
Yes? What can I do for you?

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.450
I was just wondering...

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.360
You're pregnant, right?

01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.480
Is there a problem with it?

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.560
Well...
we can't talk here in public, so...

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.740
Can you come to the principal's office?

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.810
Ah. So you're home.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:47.780
Sorry for barging in.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.440
Welcome home.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.040
It surprised us
when you suddenly quit teaching.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.400
So it's true...

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.780
We got the news from school.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.000
Father.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.440
Hmm?

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:21.640
It's not her.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.080
She's not Ryouko.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.880
She's not Ryouko!

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.880
What are you saying?

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.340
Father, call the police.
Call the police immediately!

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.340
Hey, are you okay?

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.460
Father!

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:24.240
It's me.
There're two bodies for you to eat.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.260
Leaving school already?

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.980
I knew this would happen sooner or later.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.560
What about Shimada Hideo?

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.060
He will continue to watch over you.

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.720
And besides,
he's going to be fine in this environment.

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.460
What do you mean?

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:41.080
Like me, he rarely eats human meat.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.220
Even Shimada?

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.140
Right now, there seems to be a problem.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.960
If we learn not to eat humans,

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.260
the problem will be solved, right?

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.160
It is possible.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.500
So even Shimada, too...

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.080
Like you said, if you can adapt to this world,
then there won't be a problem anymore.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.460
Wait a minute.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.280
Didn't he also take over the body of someone else?

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.380
And even so,
I still can't believe anything you'll say.

01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:24.740
Yo.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.220
I asked him to be our model.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.900
Satomi, want to join us?

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:36.410
Ah, no, I'm fine.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.530
Hey.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.050
Hmm?

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:41.720
Is your relationship with Shinichi doing okay?

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:42.740
Huh?

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:45.020
I-I don't know what you're trying to say.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.680
So, on to the next pose.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.880
In that case...

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.600
Put your hand over here.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.160
Now then,

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:00.120
face over here...

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.920
Perfect.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.920
Honestly, your style is something...

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.100
Like you're not human.

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.900
Just kidding.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.920
Why did you have to do that?

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.220
I was even kind to you.

01:20:42.701 --> 01:20:49.236
1, 2, 3...

01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:55.843
4, 5, 6...

01:20:56.845 --> 01:20:58.440
7...

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.620
8 people.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.940
Did you hear that?

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.820
I can sense Shimada Hideo's killing intent!

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.960
Even here in school!?

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.340
Where is Shimada!?

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.160
We shouldn't approach him!

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.680
As if I would listen to that!

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.480
I promise you.

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.140
I will make it painless.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.260
So please remain silent.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.180
Everybody, run!

01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:47.580
C'mon! Make it quick!

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.520
Where did that scream came from!?

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.240
It definitely came from the Art Room.

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:18.480
I can also sense Shimada's killing intent.
Don't go near him. Don't go near him!

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.720
Shinichi!

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.140
Move! Out of the way!

01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:57.700
Calm down, Shinichi!

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.860
I-I can't-- I can't--

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.600
You've got to calm down!

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.880
M-My...

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.320
my classmates...

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.600
It's alright, Shinichi.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.570
Your heart won't get destroyed again.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.850
Everything's alright.

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.620
You will be... alright.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:30.320
He's lost control of himself.

01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:35.740
Let's take him down.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.220
One more incoming...!

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.620
Tamiya...

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.900
Shimada Hideo.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.690
You look horrible.

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:59.410
I-I-I can't return to my original form anymore.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.730
Help me...

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:06.000
I hate comrades who drag me down.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.810
Shinichi, run!

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:16.940
We're going!

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.290
Everything's alright, Satomi!

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.930
Did he go west?

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.770
We've just past the stairs.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.690
Surveillance is continuing.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.610
Be careful. Roger.

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:10.010
Hey...

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.530
Hey!

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:13.570
You!

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.460
Shinichi, this may surprise you.

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:55.260
But I can still sense Shimada's killing intent!

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.840
He's heading to the roof.

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.130
It looks impossible... for an ordinary human.

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.570
See yah...

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.850
Shimada.

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:16.760
Shinichi, someone's here.

01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.000
I'll disappear for a while.

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.650
Why come just to say that?

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.760
I've killed 13 people.

01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:42.450
I should've killed you and Shimada from the start.

01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:45.240
If you kill me,
you'll also kill the child inside me.

01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:50.290
Can you kill a human child?

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.140
Tamiya Ryouko.

01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:54.460
What are you going to do

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.080
with that human child?

01:31:58.690 --> 01:31:59.820
I'll also

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:01.980
be using him for my experiments.

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:04.450
Don't you dare...!

01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:05.770
Izumi Shinichi.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.180
Mothers are

01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.020
quite a strange breed of human beings?

01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:16.850
To become a mother...

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:19.650
I have to see it through for myself.

01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:23.670
Where does their strength come from?

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.030
I want to know.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.300
This...

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.200
is where you'll find A.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.710
Is it here?

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.250
Yeah.

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:04.300
Don't be reckless.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:06.970
I know!

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.280
Don't slice up her body.

01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:27.410
It's still my mom's body, after all.

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:29.410
We'll aim for the head.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.000
Got it, Migi?

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:33.200
Shinichi.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.010
Something serious is about to happen.

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.380
We have to retreat.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.200
Huh? What are you saying?

01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:40.730
I feel sleepy.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:41.990
What!?

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:44.180
I can't bear this sleepy feeling.

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.840
Why now of all times!?

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.150
I don't have a say in this.

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:49.730
Let's retreat.

01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:51.490
C'mon! It's right in front of us!

01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:55.760
Then good luck.

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:57.130
Hey, Migi!

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.690
The only thing I could do, at least...

01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.100
is this...

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.730
You can't be serious...!

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.720
How did you survive?

01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:23.050
Doesn't matter...

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:38.930
Humans can't move that fast.
What happened?

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:42.150
Mom, I'm coming for you now.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.460
Please stop, Shinichi.

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:11.210
Why are you doing this?
It's me, your mom...

01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:35.560
Mom...

01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:03.480
Looks like you've succeeded.

01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:06.540
In the end...

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:10.680
mom saved me again.

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:14.280
I see.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.170
Even so, Migi...

01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:20.620
It seems I...

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.430
may really be just like you.

01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:30.630
When mom was taken away...

01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:33.590
even now...

01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:37.080
I can't...

01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:39.490
even cry.

01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:52.000
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

01:37:52.001 --> 01:37:57.059
(Hirokawa Takeshi, elected)

01:38:01.872 --> 01:38:04.307
<i>Even though the road to victory
may have seem long</i>

01:38:04.308 --> 01:38:07.844
<i>We thank everyone
for working hard to support us.</i>

01:38:07.845 --> 01:38:09.942
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.120
Why have we been called to HQ?

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.500
I have no idea...

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.640
Chief!

01:38:52.090 --> 01:38:54.500
May we be of some assistance?

01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:55.360
I'm Detective Hirama...

01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:57.280
And I'm Detective Tsuji .

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.280
Please provide all the information
that has been gathered.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.820
Sign here.

01:39:05.170 --> 01:39:07.050
This is a letter of confidentiality.

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:12.420
The title for this operation is,
"Human Life Protection".

01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:14.200
You are...?

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.970
I apologize. I'm one of the special forces.
I'm Yamagishi.

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.620
Special forces?

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.600
The SAT, sir?

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.770
If the number of humans could be reduced by half...

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:17.250
If the number of forests is burnt by half...

01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:22.760
If the number of human beings is reduced to a hundred...

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:28.660
Could existing waste...
become one in a hundred as well?

01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:31.380
Watching it again, I see.

01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:34.450
You really love that, don't you?

01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:38.260
Someone in the world definitely thinks so...

01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:43.160
if you want to save the lives of others.

01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:47.770
That may be true.

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:51.330
Isn't that right... Gotou?

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:56.680
We didn't know how to talk before,
but now we do.

01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:59.920
We didn't know how to move before,

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.060
but now we do.

01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:05.180
All living things

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.680
follow some kind of command.

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:13.720
Command?

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:19.380
When I took this brain,

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.880
I got a command.

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:24.280
What is it?

01:41:40.530 --> 01:41:41.650
To kill...

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.690
mankind.

01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:19.860
Migi.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:21.860
What?

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.400
I know now.

01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:28.650
The one thing I should be doing.

01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:32.480
The thing that you should do?

01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.570
I don't care who or what they are.

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:54.650
I just need to find all these parasites,
then kill them one by one.

01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:58.820
That's what I should do.

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:05.850
If we are born to destroy mankind,

01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:08.370
then you are their only hope.

01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.650
I'm going to kill their leader's child!

01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:19.710
I'm really grateful for failing to take your brain.

01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:24.540
Deceitful humans, look at this world.
Aren't you all the ones destroying everything!?

01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:27.480
Everyone in this world forgets...

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.880
If the lives of people are protected...

01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:32.250
Shinichi is human.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:35.500
I have to find them!

01:49:35.170 --> 01:49:36.350
So, run!

01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:45.720
Migi!
